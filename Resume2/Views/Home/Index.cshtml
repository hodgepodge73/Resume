            </h4>
            <div style = "padding: 10px; padding-top : 0px">
                Currently I am enrolled in the University of Guelph as a second year Engineering Systems and Computing student (Coop).
                 I am originally from Sudbury Ontario where you could usually find me at one of the beaches.
                  In my free time I like to watch tv and work on my side projects (often at the same time).
                   During the school year, I like to spend as much time as I can on campus to make up for the portions that we had to do online.
                    My other interests include innertube waterpolo, sudoku, and spending time with my family.

        <div style = "padding-bottom: 10px">
           During the course of my education I have always enjoyed computer programming, math, and physics. Currently I am very interested in Artificial Neural Networks (ANN's'), Embedded Systems Design and Control Theory.
            One topic that is exciting are simulations of ecosystems and environments over time with the goal of trying to model the concepts of evolution specifically through mutation.
             Another topic I find very interesting is the exploration of Control Theory in the development of various systems (this is very important to me as it is the nature of my degree program to be a Systems Engineer).
